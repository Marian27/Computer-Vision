# Computer Vision
A set of algorithms for computer vision projects
## Description
The purpose of this repository is to keep track of computer vision algorithms that I uncounter during my practice. The code has been sourced from open access computer resources and so far mostly based on computer vision course from Stanford CS231n. https://cs231n.github.io/
