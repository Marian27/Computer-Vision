# Computer Vision Practice on CIFAR-10
A set of algorithms I have used for computer vision projects

## Description
Here I practice training and debugging implementations of the most common computer vision algorithms. 
Training data: [CIFAR-10 dataset] (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

The original implementations have been sourced from open-access resources: [Stanford Computer Vision CS231n] (https://cs231n.github.io/).
