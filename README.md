# Computer Vision Practice on CIFAR-10
A set of algorithms for computer vision projects

## Description
Here I practice training and debugging implementations of the most common computer vision algorithms. 
Training data: CIFAR-10 dataset https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

The original implementations have been sourced from open-access computer resources (Computer Vision from Stanford CS231n. https://cs231n.github.io/)
