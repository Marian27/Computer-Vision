# Computer Vision
A set of algorithms for computer vision projects
## Description
The purpose of this repository is to keep track of computer vision algorithms I encounter during my practice. The code has been sourced from open-access computer resources and is mostly based on a computer vision course from Stanford CS231n. https://cs231n.github.io/
Training data: CIFAR-10 dataset https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
